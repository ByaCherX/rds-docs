*JSX* is an embeddable XML-like syntax. It is meant to be transformed into valid JavaScript, though the semantics of that transformation are implementation-specific. JSX rose to popularity with the *React* framework, but has since seen other implementations as well. TypeScript supports embedding, type checking, and compiling JSX directly to JavaScript.

## Basic usage
In order to use JSX you must do two things.
- Name your files with a `.tsx` extension
- Enable the `jsx` option
