*JSX* is an embeddable XML-like syntax. It is meant to be transformed into valid JavaScript, though the semantics of that transformation are implementation-specific. JSX rose to popularity with the *React* framework, but has since seen other implementations as well. TypeScript supports embedding, type checking, and compiling JSX directly to JavaScript.

## Basic usage
In order to use JSX you must do two things.
- Name your files with a `.tsx` extension
- Enable the `jsx` option

## The as operator
Recall how to write a type assertion:
```js
const foo = <foo>bar;
```
This asserts the variable `bar` to have the type `foo`. Since TypeScript also uses angle brackets for type assertions, combining it with JSXâ€™s syntax would introduce certain parsing difficulties. As a result, TypeScript disallows angle bracket type assertions in `.tsx` files.

Since the above syntax cannot be used in `.tsx` files, an alternate type assertion operator should be used: as. The example can easily be rewritten with the `as` operator.
```js
const foo = bar as foo;
```
The `as` operator is available in both `.ts` and `.tsx` files, and is identical in behavior to the angle-bracket type assertion style.
