## Description
Number is a primitive wrapper object used to represent and manipulate numbers like 37 or -9.25.
The `Number` constructor contains constants and methods for working with numbers. Values of other types can be converted to numbers using the `Number()`.

The JavaScript Number type is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value, like double in Java or C#. This means it can represent fractional values, but there are some limits to what it can store. A Number only keeps about 17 decimal places of precision; arithmetic is subject to rounding. The largest value a Number can hold is about 1.8Ã—10308. Numbers beyond that are replaced with the special Number constant Infinity.

A number literal like 37 in JavaScript code is a floating-point value, not an integer. There is no separate integer type in common everyday use. (JavaScript now has a BigInt type, but it was not designed to replace Number for everyday uses. 37 is still a Number, not a BigInt.)

Number may also be expressed in literal forms like *0b101*, *0o13*, *0x0A*. Learn more on numeric lexical grammar here.

## constructor

### Number() constructor
The `Number()` creates a Number object.
```js
new Number(value)

// example
const a = new Number('123'); // a === 123 is false
const b = Number('123');     // b === 123 is true
a instanceof Number;         // is true
b instanceof Number;         // is false
```

#### Literal syntax
```js
123    // one-hundred twenty-three
123.0  // same
123 === 123.0  // true
```

#### Function syntax
```js
Number('123')  // returns the number 123
Number('123') === 123  // true

Number("unicorn")  // NaN
Number(undefined)  // NaN
```
