### :any-link
The `:any-link` CSS *pseudo-class* selector represents an element that acts as the source anchor of a hyperlink, independent of whether it has been visited. In other words, it matches every `<a>` or `<area>` element that has an `href` attribute. Thus, it matches all elements that match `:link` or `:visited`.

### :autofill
The `:autofill` CSS *pseudo-class* matches when an *`<input>`* element has its value autofilled by the browser. The class stops matching if the user edits the field.

### :checked
The `:checked` CSS pseudo-class selector represents any radio (`<input type="radio">`), checkbox (`<input type="checkbox">`), or option (`<option> in a <select>`) element that is checked or toggled to an on state.

### :disabled
The `:disabled` CSS *pseudo-class* represents any disabled element. An element is disabled if it can't be activated (selected, clicked on, typed into, etc.) or accept focus. The element also has an enabled state, in which it can be activated or accept focus.
